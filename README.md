# 🎈 CustomerChurn
Data-Driven Insights to Minimize the customer retention.

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze customer churn behavior using the Telco Customer dataset. The goal is to identify key factors that influence customer churn and provide actionable recommendations to reduce churn rates. The project is part of a larger portfolio designed to build strong data analysis, visualization, and storytelling skills.

### 🔍 Key Objectives:

- 📉 Contract Type: Longer contracts significantly reduce churn. Month-to-month users churn at ~42%, compared to only ~2.8% for 2-year contracts.
- 📈 Monthly Charges: Higher monthly charges are linked with higher churn rates.
- 🔒 Tech Support, Online Security & Backup: Customers without these services are far more likely to churn.
- 💳 Payment Method: Electronic check users churn the most (~45%), while automatic methods like credit card or bank transfer show lower churn.
- 🧾 Paperless Billing: Customers using paperless billing churn at a higher rate (~33%) than those who don’t (~16%).
